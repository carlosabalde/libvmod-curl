This vmod provides cURL bindings for Varnish so you can use Varnish
as an HTTP client and fetch headers and bodies from backends.

WARNING: a temporary workaround to allow using the VMOD in vcl_backend_.*
subroutines has been added (see https://github.com/varnish/libvmod-curl/issues/23).
The VMOD behaves as usual, but you should always complete execution of each
cURL request during a single VCL phase (i.e. vcl_recv, vcl_backed_response,
vcl_deliver, etc.). Otherwise, some unexpected behavior may arise. Anyway,
this is the usual approach when using the VMOD.

Usage:

./configure

Make targets:
make - builds the vmod
make install - installs your vmod
make check - runs the unit tests in src/tests/*.vtc

To use the vmod do something along the lines of:

import curl;

sub vcl_recv {
    curl.get("http://example.com/test");
    if (curl.header("X-Foo") == "bar") {
        ...
    }
    curl.free();
}

See src/vmod_curl.vcc for the rest of the callable functions.

Development of this VMOD has been sponsored by the Norwegian company
Aspiro Music AS for usage on their WiMP music streaming service.
